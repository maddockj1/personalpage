    Hi! Im John. I grew up in Georgia and moved to Colorado 5 years ago.  I graduated college from the University of Dayton. I have one sibling named Brittany who moved to Colorado after I did because she copies everything I do. My parents then decided they couldnâ€™t live without us and also followed me out here.
</span></p>

     After moving to Colorado I discovered how much I loved to snowboard and have been doing that as much as possible since then. I also enjoy hiking, biking, taking photos, and climbing. I currently work very part time at REI fixing bicycles and skis, and I also used to work part time for customer service at the Electric Tobaconist.
